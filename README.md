## Introduciton

In the field of algebraic topology, the cell complex offers a broader and more versatile description compared to the simplicial complex. Its structure allows for greater flexibility in theoretical arguments, avoiding the rigid face constraints inherent in the simplicial complex [4].  


## Mathematical formulation

For a given topological filtration $\emptyset \subseteq X_1 \subseteq X_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq X_n$, $A \subseteq X$, and $\sim_A$ an equivalence relation on $A$, one can regard $\sim_A$ as an equivalence relation on each $X_i$. Actually, for each space $X_i$ one can define it as the least equivalence relation generated by the $\sim_A$, which is again denoted as $\sim_A$ by abusing the notations. 

Furthermore, based on the equivalence relation $\sim_A$ each $X_i$ admits the quotient space $X_i/\sim_A$. By the universal property of quotient spaces, the original filtration $\emptyset \subseteq X_1 \subseteq X_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq X_n$ induces the following filtration of quotient spaces:

$$\emptyset \subseteq X_1/\sim_A \subseteq X_2/\sim_A \subseteq \cdots \subseteq X_n/\sim_A,$$

where the inclusion relations are based on the canonical one-to-one and continuous map $X_i/\sim_A \hookrightarrow X_{i+1}/\sim_A$ with $[x] \mapsto [x]$. Furthermore, the functoriality of homology induces the following persistent homology

$$0 \xrightarrow{} H_q(X_1/\sim_A) \xrightarrow{\psi_1} H_q(X_2/\sim_A) \xrightarrow{\psi_2} \cdots \xrightarrow{\psi_{n-1}} H_q(X_n/\sim_A)$$

of vector spaces over the binary field $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. We call it the _q-th persistent homology of the quotient space filtration_.

From a computational perspective, this project focuses on the construction of _quotient complex (QC) filtration_ based on a filtration of simplicial complexes 

$$\emptyset \subseteq K_1 \subseteq K_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq K_n.$$

In particular, we consider $A$ as the vertex set of $K_1$, i.e., the set of $0$-simplices of $K_1$, and define an equivalence relation $\sim_A$ that ``glues'' some points of $A$ together. Based on the equivalence relation, we may define $\overline{K_i} = K_i/ \sim_A$ and obtain the following filtration of cell complexes:

$$\emptyset \subseteq \overline{K_1} \subseteq \overline{K_2} \subseteq \cdots \subseteq \overline{K_n}.$$

In this project, we develop a tool based on the Gudhi package [1] to construct and build the QC filtration and its persistent homology.
